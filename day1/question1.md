What is HTTP 1.1?
     The Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or HTTP, is an application protocol that has been the de facto standard for communication on the World Wide Web .
     HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it.
     Introduced persistent connections, which allowed multiple requests and responses to be sent over a single connection.
     Introduced support for chunked encoding to reduce latency and improve performance.
     Introduced caching to reduce the number of requests to the web server.
     Introduced SSL/TLS encryption and authentication/access control mechanisms for security enhancements.	

What is HTTP 2?
     HTTP/2 makes web pages load faster and more efficiently by streamlining communication between the browser and server.
     HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.
     Introduced support for server push to reduce latency and improve performance.
     Introduced header compression to reduce overhead and improve performance.
     Introduced support for pipelining to reduce latency and further improve performance.

Difference between HTTP 1.1 and HTTP 2:
HTTP 1.1:
    It works on the textual format.
    There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources.
    It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages.
    It compresses data by itself.

HTTP 2:
    It works on the binary protocol.
    It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple request.
    It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages .
    It uses HPACK for data compression.

Features of HTTP 1.1 and HTTP 2:

        Features	                                HTTP/1.1               HTTP/2
    Widespread Support	              ---             Yes	              Limited
    Simple and Well-Understood        ---	          Yes	                No
          Compatible with Existing 
    Infrastructure	                  ---             Yes	                No
    Limited Performance	              ---             Yes                   No

Methods used in HTTP 1.1:
    Connect, Head, Options, Delete, Post, Trace, Get, Put, Patch.

Methods used in HTTP 2:
    Binary, Header Compression, An updates protocol stack, Multiplexing, Stream prioritization, Encryption, HTTP/2 server push, Connect, Security.

Advantages of HTTP 1.1:
    Improved performance over HTTP 1.0 due to the introduction of persistent connections, caching, and support for chunked encoding.

Disadvantage of HTTP 1.1:
    Still relatively slow compared to modern web applications.
    Limited support for server push, header compression, and pipelining.

Advantages of HTTP 2:
    Significant improvement in performance over previous versions of HTTP due to multiplexing, server push, binary framing, and other enhancements.

Disadvantages of HTTP 2:
    Limited adoption and support, especially among older web browsers and servers.
